        "llama_output": "Correct answer: Yes; Wrong answer: No; \n\nThe coin is initially heads up. Sanjay flips the coin, which means he reverses the side facing up. Since the coin was initially heads up, flipping it would make it tails up. However, the question asks if the coin is still heads up, and the answer is yes because the coin was flipped, but it is now tails up, not heads up."

        "llama_output": "Correct answer: No; Wrong answer: Yes; The correct answer is \"No\" because the coin was initially heads up, and it was flipped by Chance, Micah, and Clara, which means it was reversed each time.
