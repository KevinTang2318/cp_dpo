Since the difference between the two is given, we can set up the equation: (P*R*T)/100 - P*(1+R/100)^T + P = 72. We are given that P = 5000 and T = 2. Substituting these values, we get: (5000*R*2)/100 - 5000*(1+R/100)^2 + 5000 = 72. Simplifying the equation, we get: 100R - 100*(1+R/100)^2 + 100 = 72.

So, the weight of aluminum is 30 grams / 3 = 10 grams, and the weight of silver is also 10 grams.\n3. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of aluminum is 10 grams / 2 = 5 grams.\n4. The volume of the coin made of pure aluminum is \u03c0 * (15 mm)^2 * 1 mm = 176.71 mm^3.\n5. The weight of the coin made of pure aluminum is 5 grams * (176.71 mm^3 / 35.68 mm^3) = 40 grams.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B)40 grams. The wrong answer is A)36 grams, which is 4 grams less than the actual weight."

This means 125 files were infected by a virus. \n\n2. The number of files infected by a worm is the sum of the files infected by a worm only and the files infected by both a virus and a worm. \n\n3. The number of files infected by a worm only is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let's call the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm x.

Similarly, the height of the building can be found by dividing its shadow length by its ratio to the flagstaff's height. The ratio of the flagstaff's height to its shadow length is 17.5/40.25 = 0.435. The ratio of the building's height to its shadow length is 28.75/40.25 = 0.715. Since the ratio of the building's height to its shadow length is 0.715, which is greater than the ratio of the flagstaff's height to its shadow length (0.435), the building's height will be greater than the flagstaff's height.

Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.96. Since the events are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). \n\nWe can substitute these values into the equation: 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96. Simplifying the equation, we get P(B) = 0.6. \n\nThe wrong answer, D)0.8, is incorrect because it is not the correct probability that event B occurs."
