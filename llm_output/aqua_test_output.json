        "correct": "B",
        "llama_output": "Answer: B)10; \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.\n2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.\n3. 20 large cakes are needed.\n4. 700 small cakes are needed.\n\nTo find the number of helpers needed, we need to find the number of large cakes and small cakes that can be made in 3 hours.\n\nFor large cakes: Each helper can make 2 large cakes/hr. In 3 hours, each helper can make 2 x 3 = 6 large cakes. To make 20 large cakes, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 helpers.\n\nFor small cakes: Each helper can make 35 small cakes/hr. In 3 hours, each helper can make 35 x 3 = 105 small cakes. To make 700 small cakes, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7 helpers.\n\nThe maximum number of helpers required is the maximum of the two, which is 7 helpers for small cakes. However, we need to consider that each helper can make both large and small cakes. Therefore, we need the minimum of the two, which is 4 helpers for large cakes.\n\nSince each helper can make both large and small cakes, we need to find the number of helpers that can make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours. Let's assume x helpers are needed. Each helper can make 6 large cakes and 105 small cakes in 3 hours. Therefore, x helpers can make 6x large cakes and 105x small cakes in 3 hours.\n\nWe need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n6x = 20\n105x = 700\n\nSolving the first equation, we get x = 20/6 = 10/3. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 helpers.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because we need to consider the number of small cakes that can be made. The correct answer is the minimum of the two, which is 10 helpers."

Sachin's age 10 years back was 30 - 10 = 20.\n5. Since Sachin's age 10 years back was 2x, we can set up the equation 20 = 2x.\n6. Solving for x, we get x = 10.\n7. This means that Ajay's age 10 years back was 10.\n8. Therefore, Ajay's current age is 10 + 10 = 20.\n9. However, the question asks for Ajay's age in 10 years, which would be 20 + 10 = 30.\n10. But the question also states that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, which means that Sachin's current age is 30.\n11.

However, the question asks for Ajay's age today, not in 10 years. So, we need to subtract 10 from Ajay's current age to get his age today.\n14. Ajay's age today is 15 - 10 = 5.\n15. But the question asks for Ajay's age in years, not months. So, we need to add 10 to Ajay's age today to get his age in years.\n16. Ajay's age in years is 5 + 10 = 15.\n17. However, the question asks for Ajay's age in years if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. So, we need to add 10 to Ajay's age in years to get his age in years if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\n18. Ajay's age in years if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years is 15 + 10 = 25.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)25."

Together, their rate is (1/40 + 1/45) of the wall per minute, which simplifies to 1/18 of the wall per minute.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to construct the wall together, we can invert this rate: 1 / (1/18) = 18 minutes.

The remainder obtained by subtracting 6 from Ajay's present age and dividing it by 18 is equal to Rahul's age.\n2. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. So, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.\n3. Since the remainder obtained by subtracting 6 from Ajay's present age and dividing it by 18 is equal to Rahul's age, we can set up the equation: (Ajay's present age - 6) mod 18 = 3.\n4. To solve for Ajay's present age, we can add 6 to both sides of the equation: Ajay's present age - 6 = 3 mod 18 + 6.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: Ajay's present age = 3 mod 18 + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9.\n6. Since Ajay's present age is 9, we can add 6 to get the original age: Ajay's present age = 9 + 6 = 15.\n7. However, the options do not include 15, so we need to find the closest option. The closest option is 60, which is 45 years older than 15.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)60."

The total number of members initially is 64 + 40 = 104. The same number of boys and girls joined the group, so the number of boys and girls that joined is the same. Let's say the number of boys and girls that joined is x. Then, the total number of members now is 104 + 2x. The ratio of boys to girls is still 4:3, so the number of boys is 4/7 of the total number of members and the number of girls is 3/7 of the total number of members. We can set up the equation:\n\n(4/7) * (104 + 2x) = 64 + x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(8/7) * 104 + (8/7) * 2x = 64 + x\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n832/7 + 16x/7 = 64 + x\n\nMultiplying both sides by 7, we get:\n\n832 + 16x = 448 + 7x\n\nSubtracting 448 from both sides, we get:\n\n384 + 16x = 7x\n\nSubtracting 7x from both sides, we get:\n\n384 = x\n\nSo, the number of boys and girls that joined is 384/2 = 192.
