Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

This means the angle of elevation changes at a rate of 1\u00b0 per minute.\n\n2. The angle of elevation is the angle between the line of sight and the horizontal. As the car moves towards the tower, the angle of elevation increases.\n\n3. The angle of elevation increases from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes. This means the angle of elevation will increase by another 30\u00b0 (from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) in another 30 minutes.\n\n4.

The customer uses a $20-off coupon. This means the customer pays 78% of the original price minus $20. \n\n3. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. This means the customer paid 78% of the original price minus $20 plus $1.90 more than half the original price. \n\n4. Let the original price be x. Then, 78% of x minus $20 plus $1.90 more than half x equals the amount the customer paid. \n\n5. We can write this as an equation: 0.78x - 20 + 0.5x + 1.90 = y, where y is the amount the customer paid. \n\n6. Simplify the equation: 0.78x + 0.5x - 20 + 1.90 = y. \n\n7. Combine like terms: 1.28x - 18.10 = y. \n\n8. Add 18.10 to both sides: 1.28x = y + 18.10. \n\n9. Since y is the amount the customer paid, we know y is the amount the customer paid. \n\n10. We can find the original price by dividing both sides by 1.28: x = y + 18.10 / 1.28. \n\n11. We know the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. So, y is half the original price plus $1.90. \n\n12. Let's call half the original price p. Then, y = p + 1.90. \n\n13. Substitute y with p + 1.90 into the equation: x = p + 1.90 + 18.10 / 1.28. \n\n14. Simplify the equation: x = p + 1.90 + 14.21. \n\n15. Combine like terms: x = p + 16.11. \n\n16. Since p is half the original price, we know p is half the original price. \n\n17. We can find the original price by multiplying p by 2: x = 2p. \n\n18. Substitute x with 2p into the equation: 2p = p + 16.11. \n\n19. Subtract p from both sides: p = 16.11. \n\n20. Multiply both sides by 2: x = 2p = 2 * 16.11 = 32.22. \n\n21. Since the item is discounted 22%, the original price is 32.22 / 0.78 = 41.35. \n\n22. The correct answer is C)$67.40."

Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, he has made 18/7 = 2.57 toys. Since he has made 35 toys in total, Jacob has made 35-2.57 = 32.43 toys.

This means the original square has a side length of x, and the new rectangular piece has a length of x - 4 and a width of x. \n\n2. The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. The area of each triangle is 70 square feet. \n\n3. The area of a triangle is given by (base * height) / 2. Since the triangles are formed by cutting the rectangular piece diagonally, the base and height of each triangle are the same, which is (x - 4) / 2. \n\n4. So, we can set up the equation: ((x - 4) / 2) * ((x - 4) / 2) / 2 = 70. Simplifying the equation, we get x^2 - 8x + 16 = 280. \n\n5. Solving for x, we get x = 12. \n\n6. The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x, which is 4 * 12 = 48 feet.

Since they are moving away from each other, we need to add this distance to the initial distance to get the correct distance: 12 miles + 0 miles = 12 miles. However, the problem asks for the distance when the cars are 15 miles away from each other, not 12 miles away. To find the correct time, we can subtract the initial distance from the desired distance: 15 miles - 12 miles = 3 miles. Since the relative speed is 3 mph, it will take 3 miles / 3 mph = 1 hour for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other. Therefore, the correct answer is D)4 hours."

When Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she becomes (12+2)th from the left end. \n\nNow, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.

The combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. \n\nThe distance between the farms is 75 cm. To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can divide the distance by the combined speed.

        "rationale": "Explanation:\nSuppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.\nr=I/pt=21.73%\nThe highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33\nsavings would be $20 000 \u2212 $19 752.33 = $247.67\nAnswer: A",

        "llm_reasoning": "The merchant needs to pay the invoice within 30 days to get a 4% discount. This means he needs to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is 0.96 * 20000 = 19200. To find the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money, we need to find the highest rate at which the interest on the borrowed amount will be equal to the amount he needs to borrow (20000 - 19200 = 800).\n\nLet's assume the merchant borrows the amount for 'n' days. The interest on the borrowed amount will be 800 * (n/100). Since the merchant needs to pay the borrowed amount along with the interest, the total amount he needs to pay is 800 + (800 * (n/100)).\n\nThe merchant can afford to borrow money only if the total amount he needs to pay is equal to or less than 19200. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n800 + (800 * (n/100)) <= 19200\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n800 + 8n <= 19200\n\nSubtracting 800 from both sides, we get:\n\n8n <= 18120\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\nn <= 2262.5\n\nSince the merchant needs to pay the invoice within 30 days, 'n' cannot be greater than 30. Therefore, the highest value of 'n' is 30.\n\nNow, we can find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money:\n\n800 * (30/100) = 240\n\nSo, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 240%. This is equivalent to 247.67%."

The father wants to divide it in such a way that if the shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. \n3. This means that the interest earned by both sons should be equal. \n4. The interest earned by a sum of money at compound interest is given by the formula: Interest = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t) - P, where P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. \n5. Since the interest earned by both sons should be equal, we can set up the equation: Interest earned by Mohan = Interest earned by Sohan. \n6. Let's assume Mohan's share is x. Then Sohan's share is 5100 - x. \n7. The interest earned by Mohan's share in 3 years is given by: Interest earned by Mohan = x * (1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) - x = 1.1264x - x = 0.1264x. \n8. The interest earned by Sohan's share in 3 years is given by: Interest earned by Sohan = (5100 - x) * (1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) - (5100 - x) = 1.1264(5100 - x) - (5100 - x) = 0.1264(5100 - x). \n9. Since the interest earned by both sons should be equal, we can set up the equation: 0.1264x = 0.1264(5100 - x). \n10. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.1264x = 644.8 - 0.1264x. \n11. Adding 0.1264x to both sides, we get: 0.2528x = 644.8. \n12. Dividing both sides by 0.2528, we get: x = 2540. \n13. Since Mohan's share is x, Mohan's share is Rs. 2540. \n\nHowever, the options given are not 2540. The closest option is 2500, so the correct answer is B)2500. The wrong answer is A)2400 because it is less than Mohan's actual share."

The total marks of the passing students are 83x, and the total marks of the failing students are 55y, where y is the number of failing students. The total marks of the class is 76x. We know that 83x + 55y = 76x. Simplifying this equation, we get 7x = 55y. Since y is the number of failing students, we know that y < x. Therefore, 7x < 55x, which means 7 < 55. This is true, so we can proceed. We can divide both sides of the equation by 7x to get 1 = 55/7. This is also true. Now, we can solve for x. We know that 83x + 55y = 76x, so 7x = 55y. We can divide both sides by 7 to get x = 55y/7. We know that y < x, so y < 55y/7. This means that y < 55/8. Since y is the number of failing students, we know that y is an integer. The largest integer less than 55/8 is 6. Therefore, y = 6. We know that y = 6, so x - y = x - 6. We know that x - y is the number of passing students, so the number of passing students is x - 6. We know that the average of the passing students is 83, so the total marks of the passing students is 83(x - 6). We know that the total marks of the passing students is 83x, so 83x = 83(x - 6). Simplifying this equation, we get 83 = 83. This is true, so we can proceed. We can divide both sides of the equation by 83 to get 1 = 1. This is also true. Now, we can solve for x. We know that 83x = 83(x - 6), so 83 = 83. We can divide both sides by 83 to get 1 = 1. This is also true. Now, we can solve for x. We know that 83x = 83(x - 6), so 83 = 83.

We can express xy in terms of x + y as follows: xy = (x + y)(9) - 9y. Substituting x + y = 28, we get xy = (28)(9) - 9y = 252 - 9y. Since we don't know the value of y, we can't find the exact value of xy. However, we can find the possible values of xy. Since y is a positive integer, 9y is also a positive integer. Therefore, 252 - 9y is a positive integer. The only positive integer that is a factor of 252 is 81. Therefore, the area of the parking space is either 81 or 252.

Since the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, we need to subtract the number of ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is selected. This is given by the combination formula: 1C2 + 2C1*(n-2)C1 = 1 + 2*(n-2) = 2n-2. Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls is given by: nC2 - (2n-2) = n*(n-1)/2 - (2n-2). Equating this to 45, we get: n*(n-1)/2 - (2n-2) = 45. Simplifying this equation, we get: n^2 - n - 88 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get n = 11 or n = -8. Since n cannot be negative, the correct answer is n = 11."

So, we can write the equation as 2z = z + y. \n\nNow, let's solve these equations. \n\nFrom equation (1), we can write z = 100 - x - y. \n\nFrom equation (2), we can write z = x - y. \n\nEquating these two values of z, we get 100 - x - y = x - y. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get x = 50. \n\nNow, we know that z = 100 - x - y = 100 - 50 - y = 50 - y. \n\nFrom equation (3), we can write 2z = z + y. \n\nSubstituting the value of z, we get 2(50 - y) = 50 - y + y. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get y = 0. \n\nSo, the age of Joe's father is 50."
