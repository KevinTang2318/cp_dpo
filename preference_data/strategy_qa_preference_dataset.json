        "llm_reasoning": "Correct answer: No; The evidence suggests that SSRI medications are generally safe and effective for treating depression in teenagers and young adults, just as they are for adults. While there may be some increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people taking these medications, this risk is still relatively low and is balanced by the potential benefits of treatment. The FDA has approved SSRIs for use in children and adolescents, and many studies have shown that they can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in this age group.\n\nWrong answer: Yes; This answer is incorrect because it implies that SSRIs are inherently unsafe for teenagers and young adults, which is not supported by the evidence. While there may be some unique considerations when treating depression in young people, such as the potential for increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, this does not mean that SSRIs are less safe for this age group overall."

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, which includes Chinese Americans. However, it's important to note that individual cases of discrimination may still occur, and it's essential to address these issues through education, community engagement, and policy changes at the local and state levels."

While it shared some similarities with English serfdom, it was not necessarily higher in status. In fact, Japanese serfs were often tied to the land and were required to provide labor and goods to their lords, similar to English serfs. The main difference was that Japanese serfdom was more decentralized and did not have the same level of social hierarchy as English feudalism. English serfdom, on the other hand, was more rigid and was characterized by a clear distinction between lords and vassals, with the lord holding absolute power over the land and the vassal owing loyalty and service to the lord.

The story features a young girl who enters a fantastical world where she encounters strange and fantastical creatures, which could be seen as promoting a belief in magic and the supernatural. Additionally, the story contains themes of rebellion and disobedience, as Alice disobeys her mother's instructions and enters the rabbit hole. These themes could be seen as promoting a lack of respect for authority and a disregard for the rules.

Beheading does not violate this principle, as it does not cause prolonged suffering or harm to the individual. \n\nWrong answer: Yes; The wrong answer would be that Paul's cause of death, beheading, violates the principle of Ahimsa because it involves taking a life. However, this is a misunderstanding of the principle, which is not about avoiding all harm or death, but about avoiding harm or violence that is unnecessary or unjust. Beheading, in this context, is a form of capital punishment that was used in ancient times, and it is not necessarily a violation of Ahimsa."

It is unlikely that a court would find keelhauling to be a fair punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nWrong answer: Yes, because keelhauling was a common punishment in the 18th century, and it was considered a fair and effective way to discipline sailors.

For instance, the country has a national motto (\"In God We Trust\") and a national day of prayer, which can be seen as promoting a particular religion. Additionally, many government officials and politicians often invoke God or religion in their speeches and actions, which can blur the line between church and state. Furthermore, some government programs and services, such as those provided by faith-based organizations, can be seen as promoting religion.\n\nOn the other hand, the wrong answer is \"No\" because some people might argue that the USA has a strong tradition of separation of church and state, as enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. They might point out that the government does not establish a national religion, and that people are free to practice their religion or not as they choose. However, this perspective overlooks the many ways in which religion is still intertwined with government in the USA, as mentioned above."

Polyamorous relationships require a significant amount of emotional labor, and someone who is prone to jealousy may find it difficult to manage their emotions in a way that is respectful and considerate of their partners' needs.

However, it's worth noting that bees are relatively large and intact insects, and it's possible that some parts of the bee might survive the passage through the stomach and small intestine, potentially causing an allergic reaction or other issues in some individuals."

Global warming is a scientific phenomenon caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other forms of pollution, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Both share a common theme of unpredictability and chaos, making it understandable to compare the two. \n\nThe wrong answer is \"No\" because it is a superficial comparison that does not take into account the context and purpose of the two.

This is a large and luxurious home that would likely be considered spacious by most standards. The average American family would likely find this home to be quite impressive and comfortable.\n\nWrong answer: Yes because while the average American family may not have a 7,500 square foot mansion, they may still have a different definition of what constitutes a \"small\" home. For example, some families may be happy with a smaller home that is more cozy and intimate, while others may prefer a larger home with more space for entertaining and relaxation. Additionally, the concept of \"small\" is subjective and can vary greatly depending on personal preferences and cultural background."
