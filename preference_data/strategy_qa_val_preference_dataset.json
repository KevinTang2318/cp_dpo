The Roman alphabet and kanji characters have different stroke counts and shapes, but they do not affect the amount of paper or ink required to print a book. Therefore, switching from Roman alphabet to kanji would not reduce the number of trees needed to produce a book.\n\nThe wrong answer is \"Yes\" because it assumes that the script used to print a book affects the environmental impact of its production. This is not the case, as the environmental impact of book production is primarily determined by factors such as the source and quality of the paper, the energy used to power the printing presses, and the transportation of the books."

Cancer patients may experience temporary or permanent disabilities, but not all will meet the eligibility criteria for disability benefits.
