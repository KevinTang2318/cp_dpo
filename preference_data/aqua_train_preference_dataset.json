So, let's say Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and his father's age is z. Then, we can write the equation as: x + y + z = 100. \n\n2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means when Joe's age is z, his sister's age will be 2y. So, we can write the equation as: z + 2y = x + y. \n\n3. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means when Joe's age is z, his father's age will be 2z. Also, when his sister's age is y, his father's age will be z. So, we can write the equation as: 2z = z + y. \n\nNow, let's solve these equations. \n\nFrom equation (1), we can write z = 100 - x - y. \n\nFrom equation (2), we can write z = x - y. \n\nEquating these two expressions for z, we get: 100 - x - y = x - y. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 100 + y. \n\nFrom equation (3), we can write 2z = z + y. \n\nSubstituting z = x - y, we get: 2(x - y) = x - y + y. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 3x - y. \n\nSimplifying this equation further, we get: y = x. \n\nNow, substituting y = x in equation (2), we get: z + 2x = x + x. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: z = 2x. \n\nSubstituting z = 2x in equation (1), we get: x + x + 2x = 100. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 4x = 100. \n\nSo, x = 25. \n\nNow, substituting x = 25 in equation (2), we get: z + 2(25) = 25 + 25. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: z = 50. \n\nSo, the age of Joe's father is 50."

The number of faces of the smaller cubes that are exposed to the outside is equal to the total number of faces of the smaller cubes minus the number of faces that are not exposed to the outside. The number of faces of the smaller cubes that are not exposed to the outside is equal to the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are inside the cube. The number of faces of the smaller cubes that are inside the cube is equal to the number of smaller cubes that are inside the cube multiplied by the number of faces of each smaller cube.

The volume of the cube is 5^3 = 125 cubic centimeters, and the volume of each smaller cube is 1^3 = 1 cubic centimeter. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that are inside the cube is 125 / 1 = 125.

Since they started at the same time, the sum of these times is equal to the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart:\n\nx/55 + (x-15)/52 = t\n\nwhere t is the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart.

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation 0.018x = 72. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.018, which gives us x = 72 / 0.018 = 4,000. However, this is the number of non-defective staplers, not the total number of staplers produced. To find the total number of staplers produced, we need to add the number of defective staplers, which is 0.1x = 0.1 * 4,000 = 400. So, the total number of staplers produced is 4,000 + 400 = 4,400.

This means the total weight of the new crew is increased by 1.8 kg. \n\nLet the weight of the new man be x. The total weight of the old crew is 53 kg. The total weight of the new crew is 53 + x. \n\nThe average weight of the old crew is 53 kg / 10 = 5.3 kg. The average weight of the new crew is (53 + x) / 10 = 5.3 + 0.18 = 5.48 kg. \n\nSo, 5.48 = (53 + x) / 10. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get 54.8 = 53 + x. Subtracting 53 from both sides, we get x = 1.8 + 53 = 54.8 - 53 = 1.8. \n\nThe weight of the new man is 1.8 kg more than 53 kg, which is 54.8 kg. The closest option is 62 kg."

Since there are 45 ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, we can set up the equation n*(n-1)/2 - (n-2) = 45. Simplifying the equation, we get n^2 - n - 88 = 0. Solving for n, we get n = 8 or n = 11. However, since we are told that there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, we know that n cannot be 8 because there are only 7 ways to select two balls from a box of 8 balls such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected. Therefore, the correct answer is B)10."

This sum is equal to 10 times a perfect square, so 45k+25=10n^2. This equation can be simplified to 9k+20=10n^2. Since 9k+20 is divisible by 10, k must be even.

For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. Therefore, 25 - 4k > 0, which implies 4k < 25, or k < 25/4. Since k is an integer, the largest possible value of k is 6. However, if k = 6, the equation becomes x2 - 5x + 6 = 0, which has only one real root. Therefore, the largest integral value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots is k = 7."

Then [x] = [x], [y] = y, [x+y] = [x]+y, and [2x] = 2[x], [2y] = 2y. Therefore, L(x,y) = [x]+y+[x]+y = 2[x]+2y = 2([x]+y) = R(x,y).\n\nCase 4: x and y are both non-integers. Then [x] = [x], [y] = [y], [x+y] = [x]+[y], and [2x] = 2[x], [2y] = 2[y]. Therefore, L(x,y) = [x]+[y]+[x]+[y] = 2[x]+2[y] = 2([x]+[y]) = R(x,y).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for all positive real numbers x and y."
